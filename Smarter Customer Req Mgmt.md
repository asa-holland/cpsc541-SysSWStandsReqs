1. The article illustrates the common pitfalls managers face during the "usual" way of approaching requirements development process. According to the article, the typical issue that arises is the reliance on copying requirements from previous products without checking whether those requirements are still relevant to current customer needs. This approach often leads to unnecessary complexity and inflated costs as outdated features are maintained, while genuinely valuable features may be overlooked. The lack of proper customer validation during this phase is a key failure point, as assumptions about what the customer wants take precedence over real feedback, pushing the product development process in the wrong direction. Over-specification and under-specification, too, create their own inefficienciesâ€”either through unnecessary costs for features no one values or through inadequate attention to critical areas.

2. I think that implementation of the V-model (while theoretically sound) might be difficult in a fast-paced agile environment. The V-model seems to follow a rigid, phase-based approach with a clear distinction between development and validation stages - this strongly sounds of WaterFall to me. Agile, by contrast, thrives on constant iteration, ongoing collaboration, and frequent pivots. The two philosophies are in tension because agile methods assume requirements and validation evolve together. However, I think some of the structured verification practices in the V-model can still be valuable, provided they are made more flexible. For example, I do think there is genuine value in acknowledging that validation testing procedures should attempt to mirror the requirements gathered earlier (at each level - Product, System, Subsystem, and Component) in the process to decrease admin an communication overhead.

3. I believe that full-stack developers who are expected to contribute to the requirements development process possess a broad understanding of how systems work together. This perspective can provide many benefits when refining product requirements, as they can foresee how technical choices in one area will impact elsewhere in the system. Full-stack developers may also have experience in building rapid prototypes, which is an efficient way to test assumptions and validate requirements with stakeholders early in the development cycle. Lastly, the ability of full-stack developers to understand the entire development process enables them to offer practical, cross-disciplinary insights that may lead to ideas of improved features that may address needs identified elsewhere in the system.
